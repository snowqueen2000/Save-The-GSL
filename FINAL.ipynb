    "\n",
    "Our group collectively enjoys outdoor activities in Salt Lake City. We ski, climb, hike, and camp in the wilderness surrounding Salt Lake City. For this reason, we value the Great Salt Lake for its contribution to the local ecosystem. With increased snowfall this winter, we are curious how much it will impact the level of the Salt Lake. Snowfall isnâ€™t the only factor that can impact the water level. We also will analyze the factors of rainfall, total precipitation, and water usage. "
